  \begin{itemize}
    \item[+] Smoother distributions due to increased sample size.
    \item[+] Reconstruction of the Higgs boson itself is comparable.
    \item[--] Overlay should not be ignored (any more) by me:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Replace \textit{global} variables by a more local version
            (e.g. \texttt{\#PFOs}~$\rightarrow$~\texttt{\#PFOs in fat jet(s)}) \textit{or}
        \item Have a customized, stricter particle definition that reduces the
            overlay within the analysis \textit{and/or}
        \item Adapt the selection cuts and retrain the MVA tools.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[!] Many thanks to all who are involved in providing the (new) samples!
  \end{itemize}
